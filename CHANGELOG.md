# Changelog

All notable changes to the `will` contract are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project uses the `version` field in
[`contracts/will/Cargo.toml`](./contracts/will/Cargo.toml) as its version
identifier. Each entry below the "in Cargo.toml (change grew here)" line
gets its own [contract spec artifact](./spec) once exported.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `audit_protocol_stats` (read-only) compares the stored protocol stats with
  values recomputed from will storage. `repair_protocol_stats` overwrites the
  stored stats with the recomputed values (#441).
- [`docs/EVENTS.md`](./docs/EVENTS.md) event specification.

### Changed

- The `archived` event data is now `(owner, timestamp, reason)`; it was
  previously just `owner`.
- `reveal_and_claim` requires the pre-image to start with the XDR encoding of
  `claimant`, and it marks the slot claimed before transferring (#440).
- `release_inheritance`, `reveal_and_claim` and `emergency_checkin` reject a
  `Triggered` will that has no `trigger_time`, instead of treating the
  trigger time as `0`. Grace-deadline arithmetic is now checked (#442).

### Fixed

- Protocol stats drift: `clone_will`, `batch_create_wills` and `split_will`
  now update the counters. Release and cancellation subtract every token's
  balance, not just the primary token. `reveal_and_claim` updates both
  `balances` and the locked totals (#441).

## [0.1.0] - Initial shipped behavior

Seeded entry summarizing the contract's behavior as of this changelog's
introduction. See the [README's Contract Functions table](./README.md#contract-functions)
and [`spec/will-v0.1.0.json`](./spec/will-v0.1.0.json) for the authoritative,
up-to-date interface.

### Added

- Core will lifecycle: `create_will`, `check_in`, `trigger_will`,
  `emergency_checkin`, `release_inheritance`, `cancel_will`, `close_will`.
- Beneficiary management: `update_beneficiaries`, `renounce_beneficiary`,
  basis-point-based percentage splits (must sum to 10,000).
- Guardian override: up to 3 named guardians, weighted quorum voting via
  `guardian_trigger`, guardian list management via `update_guardians`, and
  a cooldown period after guardian-list changes before a vote can force a
  release.
- Multi-token support: a will can hold balances across multiple SEP-41
  tokens (or native XLM) simultaneously via `top_up`.
- Batch and convenience operations: `batch_check_in`, `batch_create_wills`,
  `clone_will`, `merge_wills`, `set_delegate` (delegated check-in),
  `migrate_will`, `archive_will`.
- Query surface: `get_will`, `get_wills_by_owner`,
  `get_wills_by_owner_and_status`, `get_wills_by_beneficiary`,
  `get_triggered_wills`, `get_protocol_stats`, `get_will_history`,
  `get_contract_version`.
- On-chain audit trail via `WillStatusTransition` records, retrievable
  through `get_will_history`.
- `WillError` numeric error codes for every failure mode (see the
  [README's error code reference](./README.md#error-codes)).
- Resource-cost profiling suite (`docs/RESOURCE_COSTS.md`) and a
  coverage-guided + property-based fuzzing suite (`docs/FUZZING.md`)
  covering `create_will` and `update_beneficiaries`.
