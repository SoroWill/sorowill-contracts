# Contributing to sorowill-contracts

This repo participates in the **Stellar Wave Program** on [Drips](https://drips.network/wave). Contribution work is tied to issues that maintainers tag for an active Wave, and contributors earn rewards proportional to the Points assigned to the issues they resolve.

## Ground rules

- **Do not start work on any issue until you have been assigned by the maintainer.** Applying to an issue does not mean you're assigned — wait for confirmation (via the Drips Wave dashboard or a direct assignment on GitHub) before opening a PR.
- Keep PRs scoped to the issue they resolve. Unrelated changes slow down review and can cost you the Wave window.
- Be responsive during an active Wave — issues must be resolved before the Wave ends for Points to be awarded.

## Branch naming

Use the issue number in your branch name:

```
feat/N-short-description
fix/N-short-description
```

For example: `feat/42-guardian-quorum-check` or `fix/17-checkin-deadline-rounding`.

## Pull requests

- Your PR description must reference the issue it resolves (e.g. `Closes #42`).
- Make sure `cargo test` and `cargo clippy --all-targets` both pass cleanly before requesting review.
- Add or update unit tests for any behavior change in `contracts/will/src/test.rs`.

## Local setup

See the [README](./README.md#local-setup) for toolchain installation and how to run the test suite.
